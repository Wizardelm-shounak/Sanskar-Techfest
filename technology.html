        <h4>Technology</h4>
        <p style="font-family: fantasy; color: aquamarine; line-height: 50px;">Technology is an essential component of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) education. It involves the use of tools, equipment, machines, devices,<br> and software applications to solve problems, create products, and achieve
            objectives.
            <br> Technology encompasses a wide range of fields, including computer science, electronics, telecommunications,<br> robotics, automation, and manufacturing, among others. In STEM education, technology is used to facilitate the teaching and
            learning of science,<br> technology, engineering, and math concepts. It enables students to explore and experiment with ideas, data, and information, using digital media, simulations, and<br> interactive tools. Technology also provides opportunities
            for students to collaborate, communicate, and share their work with others worldwide.</p>

                        AI, or artificial intelligence, refers to the ability of machines to mimic human-like intelligence and cognitive functions such as learning, problem-solving, reasoning, and decision-making. AI systems use various techniques such as machine learning, deep
                        learning, natural language processing, and computer vision to analyze large amounts of data, recognize patterns, and make predictions or decisions based on that data.</p>

                        Software engineering is the process of designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software applications using a structured and systematic approach. It involves the application of engineering principles, such as design, analysis, and testing, to the
                        development and evolution of software systems.

                        Data visualization is the process of presenting data in a graphical or pictorial format, such as charts, graphs, maps, and dashboards, to help users understand and analyze complex information more easily. Data visualizations enable users to see patterns,
                        trends, and relationships in the data that may not be apparent from raw data or text. They can also highlight outliers, exceptions, and anomalies that may require further investigation. </p>
