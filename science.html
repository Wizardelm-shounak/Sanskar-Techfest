            <p style="font-family: serif; line-height: 40px; color: aquamarine;">The "S" in STEM stands for Science, which involves the study of the natural world and the phenomena that occur within it. Science is a broad field that encompasses many sub-disciplines, including biology, chemistry, physics, astronomy, and
                geology,
                <br> among others. Scientists use observation, experimentation, and analysis to understand the natural world, develop new theories and hypotheses, and test their ideas through rigorous methods. Science plays a critical role in advancing
                our understanding<br> of the world and improving our lives. It has led to many significant discoveries and innovations, such as the discovery of DNA and the development of vaccines, new materials, and technologies. Scientists work in a
                variety of settings, including<br> universities, research institutions, government agencies, and private industry, and they collaborate across disciplines to solve complex problems and tackle major challenges facing society. mentioned
                below are fields that come under Science. Science can be devided in to 3 main fealds:</p>
